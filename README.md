Enchanted Pages is an e-commerce Bookstore web application built using a React app client and a Tomcat server with MySQL as a database. It's built in phases from design to end-to-end single-page web application completion. The phases are designing wireframes using Figma, building initial web pages using HTML and CSS, converting these web pages to single-page architecture using React JS and Typescript, building REST APIs to fetch data from the MySQL database using DAO pattern and JDBC, displaying fetched data from the server on the client side, writing validations for both client and server-side to ensure security.
