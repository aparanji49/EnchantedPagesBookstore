Enchanted Pages is an e-commerce bookstore web application built using a React app client and a Tomcat server with MySQL as the database. It is developed in phases, from design to the completion of the end-to-end single-page web application. The phases include designing wireframes using Figma, building initial web pages using HTML and CSS, converting these web pages to a single-page architecture using React JS and TypeScript, building REST APIs to fetch data from the MySQL database using the DAO pattern and JDBC, displaying the fetched data from the server on the client side, and writing validations for both client and server sides to ensure security.
